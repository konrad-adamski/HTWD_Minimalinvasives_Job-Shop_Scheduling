    Solves the job-shop scheduling problem using a MILP model (via PuLP) to minimize the total tardiness across all jobs.
    The model accounts for the technological order of operations within each job, ensures
    that no two operations on the same machine overlap, and respects the earliest start time (arrival) for each job.
    Tardiness is defined as the amount of time a job ends after its specified deadline (if any).
    The objective is to minimize the sum of all job-specific tardiness values.
